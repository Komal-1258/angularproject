<p>
    Every business needs <a routerLink="/web">information technology,</a> but there is occasionally a misunderstanding about what really falls
    under its cover. Digital marketing is one area where there is a lot of misunderstanding. You may have been aware of
    the distinction all along or were uninformed that Information Technology and Digital Marketing were two separate
    entities. Many individuals may avoid headaches by understanding the difference.
    <br><br>
    Some business owners may wrongly believe that digital marketing is something they can delegate to their IT
    department because of that bothersome term “digital.”</p>

    <h2>Information Technology</h2>
    <p>Information technology, in its most basic sense, is the application of technology to address issues. As a result,
        many individuals believe that digital marketing is included. They believe that <a routerLink="/softwaredevelopment">IT specialists</a> can handle click
        funnels and drip marketing.</p>
        <p>In reality, Information Technology is responsible for three things:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>The development of policies and practices to make IT more efficient is referred to as governance.</li>
        <li>Operations, which include tech support, network maintenance and security, among other things.</li>
        <li>Infrastructure refers to the process of installing and maintaining all of your tangible hardware and equipment.</li>
    </ol>
       <p> All of these aspects are useful in your day-to-day activities. The optimal IT department is the one you don't even
        realise is there because you don't require tech assistance and they just keep things running in the background. The
        majority of IT workers are diligent, have strong maths skills, and have a thorough understanding of the systems they
        work with.
        <br><br>
        They may not have the necessary abilities to work in marketing or to assist you in publishing your product or
        service.</p>

    <h2>Digital Marketing</h2>
    <p>The phrase “digital marketing” refers to any type of marketing that takes place on the internet. Anything that
        employs the internet or an electronic device is considered digital marketing. The use of electronic devices or the
        internet to promote products or businesses is known as digital marketing. Text messaging, instant messaging, video,
        apps, podcasts, electronic billboards, digital television and radio channels, and other means of communication are
        all included. <a routerLink="/digital">Digital marketing</a> makes use of a variety of platforms and technology to allow businesses to examine
        campaigns, content, and strategy in real-time to see what's working and what isn't. Businesses utilise digital
        platforms such as search engines, social media, email and other websites to communicate with current and future
        customers. Communication via text or multimedia communications is also included in Digital Marketing.
        <br><br>
        So, here's the key distinction: Information Technology is largely concerned with maintaining your networks
        operational. The goal of digital marketing is to connect with people. The majority of individuals will find you
        through digital marketing (unless they hear about you from a satisfied customer). The majority of individuals start
        their search for a product or service online, and they are increasingly using mobile devices. If you entrust your
        digital marketing to your IT department, you can expect a dry, bare-bones service that won't appeal to your
        customers at all unless you're extremely lucky.
        <br><br>
        This isn't to say that information technology doesn't have a place in digital marketing; it just requires a
        different set of skills. While IT is necessary to keep your business functioning, digital marketing is becoming
        increasingly important to ensuring that it thrives.
        <br><br>
        Digital marketing is becoming more significant than “analogue” marketing, such as handing out fliers, for most
        businesses, while it is still not as important as the ever-important word of mouth. If you want your business to
        flourish, you'll need a digital marketing staff. Digital marketing strategies vary depending on the company and
        industry, as well as between B2B and B2C.</p>

    <h2>Is IT Knowledge Required for Digital Marketers?</h2>
   <p> It is not necessary for digital marketers to be IT experts. They do, however, need a good, fundamental grasp of how
    the technology they utilise works. They must be able to effectively use all of the technologies at their disposal,
    particularly when it comes to analytics measurement. This goes hand in hand with a grasp of buyer personalities.
    They must understand how the internet functions as well as how various social media networks are joined together at
    the coarse architecture level.
    <br><br>
    Most importantly, they must be able to automate anything that can be mechanised in order to free up time for the
    more <a routerLink="/graphics">creative aspects</a> of the work. After that, digital marketers must collaborate with IT to verify that everything
    put in place to support digital marketing is compatible with the rest of the company's IT infrastructure. Martech
    must be effectively connected, particularly when it comes to client data that can be used by both sales and
    marketing.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Good Digital Marketing Team?</h2>
    <p>No, you can't give it over to IT because, while they're important, it's not their area of expertise. Outsourcing
        your digital marketing to professionals is the most common solution for most businesses. Instead of bringing on a
        full-time workforce, you may pay for only the time you require.

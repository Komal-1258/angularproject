    <p>WordPress, which powers more than one-fourth of all websites, is perhaps the simplest platform to use when creating
    a blog or website if you want to establish a presence online.
    <br><br>
    Creating a <a routerLink="/web">website</a> is a crucial component of setting up your company's online infrastructure. The majority of your
    marketing and sales occur here.
    <br><br>
    The first step in creating a website is determining the developers and/or tools you'll need. Additionally, you must
    be aware of your alternatives if you wish to act honorably toward your company.
    <br><br>
    You already have a solid sense of what WordPress can accomplish for you if you've heard of Weebly or Wix. But for a
    variety of reasons, individuals prefer WordPress over these substitutes. You'll learn why today.</p>

    <h6>WordPress: What Is It?</h6>

   <p> For the development and updating of digital material, in this example, websites, WordPress is a content management
    system (CMS). It is created using PHP and a MySQL database.
    <br><br>
    WordPress employs a little HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as most things on the internet do. But WordPress does not
    require programming to function.
    <br><br>
    It has been made extremely usable by its developers and community. WordPress.org is where you can download the
    open-source, free software.
    <br><br>
    Sadly, WordPress.org is sometimes mistaken with WordPress.com, a commercial service that uses the same software as
    WordPress.org but offers much less freedom than the free version.
    <br><br>
    In 2003, Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little created the first version of WordPress. It was first recognised for being a
    simple tool for building blogs.
    <br><br>
    It has since accumulated a lot more web space. Additionally, the code has developed and been modified by its sizable
    community of open-source contributors to be used for any kind of website.
    <br><br>
    Some variation of WordPress is used by close to 40% of all websites. WordPress is used to power <a routerLink="/web">website development</a>
    for both individuals and small and large enterprises.</p>

    <h6>How Does a WordPress Developer Work?</h6>
    <p>An expert who is knowledgeable with WordPress's fundamental code and organizational structure is known as a
        WordPress developer.
    
        WordPress developers must possess in-depth understanding on how to customize a website to a business's demands, even
        though WordPress does not require programming in the conventional sense.
    
        Someone who is familiar with this will probably have experience with other popular web technologies for dynamic web
        pages, such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
    
        You may wish to be conscious of certain particular varieties of WordPress developers.</p>

    <h6>Core Developer</h6>

    <p>The platform's backend features are developed by WordPress core developers. WordPress' internal software must be
        developed by core developers. They have the ability to create code that will enhance WordPress.</p>

    <h6>Theme Developer</h6>

    <p>The general layout and style of your website are reflected in the theme. Since it includes what the user sees on
        their end, theme creation is a significant component of <a routerLink="/softwaredevelopment">front-end development.</a>
    
        A directory of hundreds of free themes may be found on WordPress.org. Making your own, however, pays off if you want
        to stand out.</p>

   <h6> Plugin Developer</h6>

    <p>It should come as no surprise that plugin developers are in charge of creating plugins. Plugins are add-ons that
        extend the functionality of websites. Using plugins is recommended since it prevents modifications to the core
        WordPress files</p>

    <h6>Why Should I Use WordPress?</h6>

   <p> WordPress is widely used, there is no doubt about it. Why is the question? The fact that WordPress is helpful does
    not, however, explain why companies prefer it over alternatives. WordPress distinguishes itself from rivals in the
    market with a few key features.
</p>
   <h6> Free</h6>

    <p>Free and open-source software will always have an advantage over paid software. Cost-cutting at this stage of

    supports a variety of website kinds.</p>

    <h6>Flexibility</h6>

    <p>WordPress creates full operating modes in addition to websites. With the aid of WordPress, everything from a social
        network to a forum may be created.</p>

            <h2>Paid Marketing</h2>
            <p>Paid digital marketing refers to when a company or brand pays to promote on various digital channels
                (mainly social media and Google). Paid search is an effective way to raise brand recognition and reach
                out to new prospective clients at the start of their buying cycle. You may use Google AdWords to target
                certain phrases and audiences, as well as tell Google how much you want to pay for clicks and how much
                money you want to spend. Paid social media marketing may be used to reach out to new consumers who share
                similar interests as your present followers, or to increase the visibility of your current material, as
                certain social media platforms, such as Facebook, limit organic reach.

            <h2>Organic marketing</h2>
            <p>Organic marketing is any type of digital marketing that does not rely on sponsored advertisements. It
                includes channels such as video sharing, influencers, and SEO. It is most typically associated with
                social media and content. Organic marketing pushes traffic to the top of your sales funnel during the
                “awareness” stage, but it also plays a role during the “consideration” stage, when buyers are weighing
                their alternatives or learning more about your product before making a purchase decision. It fosters an
                emotional bond between your customers and your business, which is the most important factor in today's
                great brand experience. Organic marketing tactics aim to build an emotional connection with your
                consumers through informative or entertaining content, putting your company in front of their minds when
                they're ready to buy.</p>

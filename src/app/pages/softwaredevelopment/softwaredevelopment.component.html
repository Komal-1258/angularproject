            <h2>AI & ML- Python</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a vast subject of computer science that focuses on developing intelligent
                machines that can do tasks that need human intelligence. Machine learning (ML) is a technique that
                allows a computer program to understand data without the assistance of a programmer. It increases its
                capacity to comprehend information over time, resulting in increasingly accurate prediction models.
                Python is user-friendly and can do the same tasks as other programming languages with fewer lines of
                code. A machine learning (ML) software may be thought of as a specialised subset of artificial
                intelligence (AI) that excels at a small range of activities. The Python community has created a number
                of modules to help programmers implement machine learning.</p>

        <p>TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework that automates the whole process. It features a
            large, flexible ecosystem of tools,<br> libraries and community resources that enable academics to push the
            boundaries of machine learning and developers to quickly build and<br> deploy ML-powered apps. TensorFlow is
            a
            single paradigm that incorporates a number of machine learning and deep learning (also known as<br> neural

            <h2 id="big">Big Data Services</h2>
            <p>Data is the lifeblood of every business, and how companies see it is crucial. The capacity to correctly
                interpret, process, extract, value, visualise, and, most crucially, communicate data would be the secret
                to a successful corporation. With big data analysis, firms can maximise the value of their data and
                fulfil their business objectives. To assist clients in profit from the big data environment, Digiware
                offers a variety of big data services, including consultancy, installation, support, and big data as a
                service. Big data enables businesses to better their operations and make faster, more informed choices.
                We assist our clients in establishing a suitable record for size and application accessibility while
                developing big data technological capabilities to generate persuasion and value.</p>

        <h2>Mixed Reality Development</h2>
        <p>Mixed reality (MR) is a user interface in which physical reality and digital material are integrated in such
            a manner that real-world and virtual items may interact with each other. Mixed reality combines digital and
            real-world settings, unlike virtual reality (VR), which immerses the user in a purely digital environment,
            or augmented reality (AR), which layers digital material on top of a physical environment. Mixed reality is
            commonly referred to as augmented reality (AR), but its ability to integrate real-world and digital aspects
            takes it further along the virtuality spectrum, which ranges from physical reality to immersive virtual
            reality.</p>

  <p class="para">The quantity of calls from clients will rise as your business expands. Customers may call to ask questions about
    your<br> products or services, get help, or make purchases over the phone. As the quantity of calls grows, your team
    will find it<br> more difficult to manage them satisfactorily. Customer self-services, also known as interactive voice
    response (IVR), is an <br>automated mechanism for callers to communicate with your company. Buyers contacting to enquire
    about your services or<br> customers purchasing your items are examples of this.
    <br><br>

        <h5 class="card-title">Promotional Bulk SMS</h5>
        <p class="card-text text-secondary">Indeed, the majority of SMS marketing initiatives involve a single message
          that must be sent to several audiences. And the only method to reach the targeted audience is through
          promotional bulk SMS. Promotional campaigns are one of the most effective ways for companies to employ text
          messaging.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Transactional Bulk SMS</h5>
        <p class="card-text text-secondary">The most significant distinction between promotional and transactional SMS
          is that transactional SMS does not send the same message to a huge number of people. This may appear to be
          very apparent, yet it is what holds the whole thing together. Companies that need to authenticate clients,
          provide confirmation or tracking information.</p>

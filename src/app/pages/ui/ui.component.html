            <h2>UX Research</h2>
            <p>UX research is described as doing thorough research into the needs of users and incorporating the
                findings into the UX design process. To analyse user behaviour and uncover issues that influence the
                entire UX, the study involves a variety of methods and methodologies. UX research encompasses a variety
                of investigative methods used to add context and insight to the design process. Unlike other sub-fields
                of UX, research did not develop out of some other field or fields. It is merely translated from other
                forms of research. In other words, UX practitioners have borrowed many techniques from academics,
                scientists, market researchers, and others. However, there are still types of research that are fairly
                unique to the UX world.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Quantitative Research</h5>
                <p class="card-text text-secondary">Any study that can be quantified is considered quantitative
                    research. It provides answers to inquiries like “how many people clicked here” and “what proportion
                    of users can find the call to action?” It’s useful for estimating statistical probabilities and
                    figuring out why a website or app isn’t working.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Qualitative Research</h5>
                <p class="card-text text-secondary">Soft research is a term used to describe qualitative research. It
                    provides solutions to queries such as “why didn’t individuals see the call to action” and “what else
                    did they observe on the page?” Interviews or chats are frequently used to do this. Qualitative
                    research aids us in comprehending why individuals behave in the way they do.</p>

            <h2>UI/UX Testing</h2>
            <p>As the name implies, user interface (UI)testing is a set of services aimed at evaluating the
                functionality, performance, and effectiveness of user interfaces. To put it another way, we test if your
                menus, forms, graphical components, buttons, and other features work and behave correctly across all
                devices and platforms. The goal of user interface (UI) testing is to provide people a good experience.
                It assists in answering the consumers’ individual needs and providing them with maximum convenience.
                Using our UI and UX testing service, you can improve the speed and efficiency of your apps, resulting in
                a better user experience. It improves the product’s total value and assists businesses in retaining
                consumers and achieving greater success. The UI/UX design test results in better-performing applications
                and favourable consumer feedback for organisations.

            <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
            <p>Designers, developers and content strategists frequently collaborate on information architecture.
                Regardless of who takes on the job, IA is a distinct discipline with its own set of influences, tools,
                and resources that are worth exploring. We’ll talk about what information architecture is and why it’s
                important in the user experience process in this post. When creating products, designers establish
                information architecture as a routine element of the UX process. Learn about information architecture,
                including how designers and product managers use design principles to create an IA, as well as IA tools
                and best practices. Information architecture (IA) is the technique of organising material on websites
                and blogs, as well as online retailers, booking applications, and downloadable software.</p>

            <h2>Dashboard Design</h2>
            <p>Dashboards show a company’s operational and strategic business intelligence data via an interface or UI /
                UX visual representation. Dashboard systems enable businesses to take focused actions by tracking data,
                creating outputs, displaying facts and figures, and delivering KPIs (key performance indicators).
                Digiware has a dashboard design and system model built in. Today, data-driven tracking systems play a
                key part in determining a company’s productive output. We also provide systems for capturing any sort of
                data, not simply business performance data. It might be your digital marketing report, online sales, HR,
                ticketing system, or sales reports, among other things. The goal is to assist you in making decisions
                based on accurate facts given in an easy-to-understand format. </p>

            <h2>Interaction Design</h2>
            <p>The practice of developing interactive digital goods and services is referred to as interaction design or
                IxD. Interaction designers pay attention to how people engage with goods and utilise communication
                principles to create the experiences they want. The phrases “interaction design” and “user experience
                design” are sometimes used interchangeably. This is logical given how closely interaction design and
                user experience design overlap. After all, UX design is all about enhancing the user’s experience with a
                product, and interaction between the user and the product is a big part of that. However, user
                experience and interaction design are not the same things. The way we approach user interactions is the
                key difference between UX and interaction design.</p>
